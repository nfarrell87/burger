# Eat-Da-Burger!

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the middle of the page under the "Burgers that are ready to eat!" section waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move up to the "Burgers that have been devoured" section.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
